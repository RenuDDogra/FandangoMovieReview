# FandangoMovieReview


Overview
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. In October 2015, Walt Hickey from 538 published a popular article from the website html code he determine the fandango website is biased in showing the true ‘RatingValue’ and inflating the rounding up instead of rounding down.

Goal:
My Goal is determine how can we determine if Fandango’s website rating in 2015 had a bias approach towards rating to sell more tickets by comparing the rating of same movies on other websites! With the help of data analysis in python based off the 538 article and data provided in data.world,github.we will see if we reach a similar conclusion. We will also try to find hows the ratingValues of movies differ in 2016.

Question we are trying to Answer here is :

1) Is there conflict of interest for a website that both sells movie tickets and display review ratings?

2) Does a website like Fandango artifically display higher review ratings to sell more movie tickets?

3) In 2016 the Fandango acquired Rotten tomatoes, we will see if the comapny is making same biasness in maitaining the rating Values of movie in 2016.
